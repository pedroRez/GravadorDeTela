**SharpAvi** is a simple .NET library for creating video files in the AVI format.
Files are produced in compliance with the [OpenDML extensions](http://www.jmcgowan.com/avitech.html#OpenDML) which allow (nearly) unlimited file size (no 2GB limit).
There are built-in encoders for video (Motion JPEG, MPEG-4) and audio (MP3). Not all of them are supported on each target platform though.
